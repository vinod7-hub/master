GIT & GITHUB

1. Git is open source version control system

                                                                                                    Committed Area
Working Area
Staging 
Development 

2. Before we should do anything in GIT operations, we should config a user details.
3. If we do not config git, it will save in a text file.

         # git config user.name  “<user>”
         # git config user.mail “<user mail>”


4. Below are the use ful commands 
	
	#git status     -> it will show the status of a tree whether it is committed or not 
	#git restore   -> which reverted to old state of file 
	#git add <file>  -> will move to staging are from working state 
	#git add . 	-> will move all the file to staging area
	#git restore –staged <file>	  -> it will revert back to working area from staging
	#git rm <file>			-> remove the file permanently
	#git log	-> will the all the details of committed file 
	#git log -n -1 	  -> will show the latest commit to the file 
	#git branch 	-> will show the branches list 
	#git checkout -b <branch>	  -> will create a new branch & change the branch
	#git branch <branch name>  -> will create a new branch
	#git checkout <branch>    -> will moved to existing branch
	#git branch -d <branch>    -> remove the branch 
5. To see the previous commit history along with branch they were commit 
	#git log - -graph - -decorate
6. To see the previous commit with only name of the file and commit text
	#git log - -name-only
7. To commit the file with a commit message 
Git commit = Save your project changes with a message
	#git commit -m “<commit message>” <file>
8. To move the stage file to commit direct without ( add command ) with a commit mess
	#git commit -am “<commit message>”
9. Git has a merged feature, which can merge two branches there are 2 types 
         I. fast forward : it can happen when the current branch has no extra commits compared to the branch that we are merging. This type of merge cannot create a new commit, but rather than merge
        II. No fast forward 
10. Basic merge command
	#git checkout master
	#git merge <merging branch name>

11. We cab add the remote repository to a local project with a git remote add command
A Git repository (or repo) is a place where Git stores your project files and their entire history. A Git repository is a project folder that tracks all changes using Git
	#git remote add origin <http://………/…..>
             i. origin : name for the remote repository, we can may have the multiple also.
12. We can list all remote repositories
	#git remote -v
13. We can push the remote
Git push = upload your committed changes to a remote repository
	#git push origin master
	i. Master : branch name ( default )
14. For cloning repository 
Git clone means making a complete copy of an existing Git repository from a remote source to your local computer.
	#git clone <http://………./….>
15. We can fetch master in order to update the origin master branch in our local repo
Git fetch means downloading the latest changes from a remote repository without changing your current work.
	#git fetch origin master
	#git merge origin/master
16. Instead of individual fetching and merging, we can also pull the origin master branch with pull command
Git pull means getting the latest changes from a remote repository and applying them to your current local branch.
In simple terms:
📥 Download updates


🔄 Automatically add them to your files

	#git pull origin master
17. We can add the files which may get conflicts while merging by using the add command
	#git add <file>
	#git merge
18. FORK : A copy of original file
It can help creating your own copy of original final project, we can make changes and merge.

JENKINS
Jenkins is an open-source automation tool used to build, test, and deploy software automatically.
It helps developers and DevOps teams automate repetitive tasks in the software development process.
Jenkins is mainly used for CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment).
Continuous Integration (CI)
Developers frequently push code to Git
Jenkins automatically:
Pulls code
Builds it
Runs tests
Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)
Jenkins automatically:
Deploys code to servers (Dev/Test/Prod)
Ensures faster releases

Role of Jenkins in DevOps
Jenkins acts as the automation backbone of DevOps.
Key Roles:
Automates CI/CD pipeline
Integrates with tools (Git, Maven, Docker, Kubernetes)
Detects errors early
Improves software quality
Speeds up delivery
Jenkins Plugins
Plugins extend Jenkins functionality.
Examples:
Git Plugin
Maven Plugin
Docker Plugin
Kubernetes Plugin
Slack Plugin
Installation steps to JENKINS
Create a VM
Login vm via root 
Install java
Create a git repository
Adding repository key to system
Append package repository to server source
Update packages 
Install jenkins 
Process of installing
#apt update
#sudo apt install openjedk-11-jdk
#wget -q -o https://pkg.jenkins.io/……….
  Sudo apt-key add -
-> next append the package repository to the server source
-> it means we are tking the jenkins repository and adding to the package manager
#sudo sh -c ‘echo deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/………
   /etc/apt/source.list.d/jenkins.list’
#sudo apt update -y
#sudo apt install jenkins 
#sudo systemctl start services
-> now open the firewall, it will allow to interact with the jenkins
#sudo ufw allo 8080
#sudo ufw status
#exit
Copy ip address
Open web browser and in search bar <ip>:8080
Then we can access jenkins, if we cant access the jenkins, we should add the inbound rules and edit them 
It will ask the passwd 
We can check the passwd in below file 
#sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPasswd
Install the plugins which will suggest 
Installation of JENKINS in Redhat - stable 
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo yum upgrade
# Add required dependencies for the jenkins package
sudo yum install fontconfig java-21-openjdk
sudo yum install jenkins
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
Start Jenkins
You can enable the Jenkins service to start at boot with the command:
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
bash
Copied!
You can start the Jenkins service with the command:
sudo systemctl start jenkins
You can check the status of the Jenkins service using the command:
sudo systemctl status jenkins
Note:
The command: sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword will print the password at console.
If you are running Jenkins in Docker using the official jenkins/jenkins image you can use sudo docker exec ${CONTAINER_ID or CONTAINER_NAME} cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword to print the password in the console without having to open an interactive shell inside the container.

Now configuration of Jenkins CLI

– open jenkins – jenkins tools – jenkins CLI – copy IP addr/link

Login to the server 
#wget http://<ip>:8080/jnlpjars/jenkins-cli.jar

Now we should
Open jenkins – profile – configure – API Token – Add new token
It will create a new token copy that

Now go back to server 
#java -jar jenkins =-cli.jar -s http://<ip>:8080/ -auth mike:<copied_token> -websocket list jobs
  I. mike - user name

Creation of CI/CD pipeline 


Goto jenkins – New Item – enter Item name – select pipe line – click on OK – new page will open scroll down – click on Try sample pipeline – Save

Now go back to the terminal & run the list jobs command again 
#java -jar jenkins =-cli.jar -s http://<ip>:8080/ -auth mike:<copied_token> -websocket build <testname>
We have configured the SSH service in Jenkins to listen on a fixed port. To find out the port in use, run the command below:

#curl -Lv http://localhost:8085/login 2>&1 | grep -i 'x-ssh-endpoint'
Now that we have the port used by the Jenkins SSH server, let us begin interacting with Jenkins over ssh with the user mike.
As mike, try running the following commands:

mike@jenkins-server:~$ ssh -i /home/mike/.ssh/jenkins_key -l mike -p 8022 jenkins-server help
Keep a note of the options used with the SSH command:
-i flag is used to point to mike's private SSH key. Remember, we have already added the public key in the Jenkins configuration.
-l is the login user which in our example is mike
-p is the port which we found out in the previous step to be 8022
Now we should restart the jenkins to interact smoothly
#ssh -i /home/mike/.ssh/jenkins_key -l mike -p 8022 jenkins-server  safe-restart






🛠 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿: Docker is the tool that allows developers to package their applications and dependencies into a container. It’s a lightweight, standalone package that can run anywhere, making development and deployment consistent across environments. Think of Docker as a virtual shipping container – it keeps everything organised and portable.

📦 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗲: Need to manage multiple containers at once? Docker Compose is your go-to tool. It allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications easily, using a single YAML file. For example, you could have a web application, database, and cache service all running in separate containers, and Docker Compose brings them together seamlessly.

👑 𝗞𝘂𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗲𝘀 (𝗞𝟴𝘀): If Docker is the foundation, Kubernetes is the crown jewel. Kubernetes is a powerful open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and managing containerized applications. It’s like a traffic controller that ensures all your containers run smoothly, whether you’re working with a single service or scaling to thousands of containers in production.

🔍 𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞: Let’s say you’ve built a web app that needs an NGINX server, a database, and a Redis cache.
With 𝘿𝙤𝙘𝙠𝙚𝙧, you can containerize each component.
Using 𝘿𝙤𝙘𝙠𝙚𝙧 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙤𝙨𝙚, you can define a docker-compose.yml file to manage the interaction between these containers locally.
Finally, with 𝑲𝙪𝒃𝙚𝒓𝙣𝒆𝙩𝒆𝙨 you can scale this app, deploy it across a cluster, and ensure everything runs efficiently.
